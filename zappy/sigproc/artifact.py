    Fit a LocalOutlierFactor model using signal channels as features. Returns an
    outlier score for each channel. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal: numpy.ndarray, shape: [n_sample x n_chan]
        Multichannel signal in which to detect outliers.

    n_neighbors: float
        Number of neighbors an inlier should have. This value is used to calculate
        each channel's outlier score. 

    Returns
    -------
    outlier_score: numpy.ndarray, shape: [n_chan]
        Outlier factor for each channel quantifying the distance of the channel
        from its nearest neighbors within the feature space. Greater values
        are associated with increased outlier likelihood.

    Update the outlier state vector based on current outlier scores of features:

    Parameters
    ----------
    otl_scores: numpy.ndarray, shape: [n]
        Continuous-valued vector of scores corresponding to the likelihood(s) that
        one or more features are outliers.

    otl_thresh: float
        Binary threshold used to define whether otl_scores values are

    otl_state: numpy.ndarray, shape: [n]
        Continuous-valued state vector X(t-1) corresponding to each feature's

    otl_decay: float
        Weighting (A) given to prior outlier states X(t-1). Greater value

        outlier state. Should not exceed value of 1.
